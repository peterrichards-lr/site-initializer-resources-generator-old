# Node.js Digest Client
### It seems, that this package does not make sense anymore, because [request.js](https://github.com/request/request#http-authentication) has implemented Digest Authentication and has more comfortable API
This module allows making requests to servers through Digest Authentication [(see wikipedia for details)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Digest_access_authentication)


## Usage
### DigestClient.get
```
var DigestClient = require('digest-client');
var digestClient = new DigestClient({username: 'foo', password: 'bar', https: true});

digestClient.get('https://hostname.com/path', function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
        return console.log(err);
    }

    console.log(result);
})
```
### DigestClient.request
```
var DigestClient = require('digest-client');
var digestClient = new DigestClient({username: 'foo', password: 'bar', https: true});

digestClient.request({
    host: 'hostname.com',
    path: '/path.json',
    port: 80,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { "User-Agent": "Shmuser-Shmagent" }
}, function (err, result) {
    if (err) {
        return console.log(err);
    }

    console.log(result);
});
```
### How it works

The digest client will make one request to the server, then parse response (which contains authentication data)
and then make authenticated request.
